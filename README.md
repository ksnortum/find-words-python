# find-words-python

## Find words for the games of Scrabble, Wordle, or a crossword

This project was originially written in Perl ([scrabble-words](https://github.com/ksnortum/scrabble-words)), then rewritten in Java 
([scrabble-words-java](https://github.com/ksnortum/scrabble-words-java)) and now rewritten in Python3.  My intension is that 
**scrabble-words-java** and this project should stay in sync (we'll see).
