# find-words-python

## Find words for the games of Scrabble, Wordle, or a crossword

The app comes with a help window that explains how to use it, but in short, you enter the letters you have and press 
*Submit*.  The app will produce a list of possible words to use.  Note that it very rarely finds the one word you need. 
These are suggestions, so you're not really cheating (sort of).

This project was originally written in Perl ([scrabble-words](https://github.com/ksnortum/scrabble-words)), then 
rewritten in Java ([scrabble-words-java](https://github.com/ksnortum/scrabble-words-java)) and now rewritten in 
Python 3.  My intention is that **scrabble-words-java** and this project should stay in sync (we'll see).

I was never a Python programmer professionally -- I am self-taught, so there may be different (better) ways to do 
things.  See **Bugs, Improvements, Suggestions**.                                             


## Prerequisites

You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or above to execute the app.  It may run on lower 
versions, but this is not guaranteed. 

You will also need the [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) framework.  To install:

    pip install PyQt5

## Running

To run, go to a command prompt, cd into `<installation-directory>/find-words-python` and in Windows:

    find-word-python.bat

...or in Linux:

    ./find-words-python.sh

You may also be able to launch these files directly from a file explorer if your system is set up to do so.  Windows 
users may want to create a shortcut.

## Tests

**find-words-python** comes with unit testing that you can run from the command line:

    cd <installation-directory>/find-words-python/tests
    python -m unittest discover -s . -t ..

## Bugs, Improvements, Suggestions

Suggestions or constructive criticism is welcome.  Shoot me an email at knute (at) snortum (dot) net.  Or, if you like 
submit a pull requests.
